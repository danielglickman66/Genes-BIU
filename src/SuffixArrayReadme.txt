SuffixArray includes a help, so to obtain updated options just run the following:
java -jar SuffixArray.jar

The standard command line uses:
java -jar SuffixArray.jar inputfolder outputfolder

Almost all options have a default (but for quicker performances use -maxlen 30)

The most useful option is -file that allows the following possibilities:
s	will run only on the smallest file of inputfolder
m	will run only on the medium file of inputfolder
l	will run only on the largest file of inputfolder
a	will run on all the files

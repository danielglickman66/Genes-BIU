 - disgard substring with zclose to 0
 
instead of using z-score , keep mean and var and use probability to get such score on a normal distr with such mean and var.

cluster sub-seq to good in A/good in B / dont care.

cluster sub-seq by edit distance to reduce features number.////- suffix :
compute pmi of substring by cutting in half and pmi = log( #(ab) / (#b * #a) )


1 seq classifier to use as prob for bayes

random mutation to create more data
